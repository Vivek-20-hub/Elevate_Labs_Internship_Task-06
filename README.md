# Sales Trends Analysis Using Aggregations

-- Project: Data-Analyst-Internship-at-ElevateLabs-Task-6
-- Dataset Source: [Kaggle - sales_data.csv]
-- Cleaned Data: cleaned_sales_data.csv (from Task 1)
Now we use the cleaned_sales_data.csv to perform sales trends analysis using aggregation. Here is a brief overview of the process:

Using the DB Browser for SQLite, create a new database.
-- Import the cleaned_sales_data.csv into the database as a table.
-- Perform SQL queries on the table.
-- Observe and note the output.
-- Save the queries in a SQL file.
-- SQL Queries and Outputs for Sales Trends Analysis using Aggregations
-- Monthly Revenue and Order Volume in 2015
